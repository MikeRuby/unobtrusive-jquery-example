h1. Rails, JQuery, Unobtrusive JS and Graceful Degradation

This is a demonstration of unobtrusive JavaScript using jQuery and Rails. The example also shows how to gracefully degrade for browsers not running JavaScript.

You will need Ruby on Rails version 2.3.5 to run this example. If you have Rails 2.3.5 you should just need to do the following:

    git clone git://github.com/aeden/unobtrusive-jquery-example.git
    cd unobtrusive-jquery-example
    script/server
  
This will start the server on localhost port 3000. You can then visit "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ to see it in action.
